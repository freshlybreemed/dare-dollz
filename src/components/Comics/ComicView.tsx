          The Fabulous life of Dare Dollz follows the crime-fighting adventures
          of four young fashionable women working for a private detective agency
          in Carnado City.

        <Paragraph>
          Things start to heat up for the girls when a new trap rapper 8 Figga
          rises in popularity. His influence on the youth is causing crimes to
          rise in the city that they are paid to protect. And two things the
          dollz donâ€™t play about is their city or their money.
